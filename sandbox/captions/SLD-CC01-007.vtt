00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
Let's talk about something that matters to everyone.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:03.920
Money.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.480
There's a direct financial connection between your communication skills and your income.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.400
Let's look at exactly how this works.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.040
Here's a real scenario that any experienced technician should understand.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.760
A customer's vehicle needs $3,500 in break and suspension work.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.120
They're hesitant.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.720
They're thinking about getting a second opinion at an independent shop.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.600
What happens next depends entirely on communication.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.840
Option A. You don't take time to explain your findings.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.480
The customer doesn't understand why this work is necessary or why it costs what it does.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.920
They decline and leave to get that second opinion.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.400
Result?

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.000
Perhaps zero flagable hours for you.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.680
Zero revenue for the dealership.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.040
Option B. You invest five minutes.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.640
You show them the worn parts.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.440
You explain the safety and performance consequences.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.600
Alongside the service advisor, you address their cost concerns professionally using your expertise.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.200
The customer understands.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.640
They approve the work.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.600
Result?

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.680
Eight hours of flagable work.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.480
Let's do the math.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.200
Time invested five minutes.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.440
Billable hours gained eight hours.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.640
Your communication skills directly affected your income.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.400
But it goes beyond this one job.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.480
That satisfied customer returns for future service.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.000
They become a loyal client with significant lifetime value.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.760
They refer other Porsche owners.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.480
And dealership success means your job security and opportunities for advancement.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.120
Here's what technicians sometimes think.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.360
I don't get paid to talk to customers.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.200
I get paid to turn wrenches.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.320
But that's backwards.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.840
Better communication isn't time away from profitable work.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.640
It's an investment in more profitable work.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.200
Five minutes of communication can create eight hours of billable work.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.200
The math works strongly in your favor.
