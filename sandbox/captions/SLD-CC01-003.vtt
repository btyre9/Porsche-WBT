00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.120
In this module, you'll learn four key concepts that establish the foundation for everything that follows.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.080
First, you'll define what it means to be a brand ambassador in the Porsche context.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.720
This isn't just a title. It's a specific set of responsibilities and expectations.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.000
Second, you'll understand how effective customer communication creates financial value.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.720
There's a direct connection between your communication skills and your income,

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.880
and we'll show you exactly how that works.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.320
Third, you'll identify the common scenarios where you interact directly with customers.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.880
These happen more often than you might think, and each one is an opportunity.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.320
Finally, you'll recognize what customers are really seeking when they ask to speak with you.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.640
Understanding this helps you meet their expectations and build trust.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.840
