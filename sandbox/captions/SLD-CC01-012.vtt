00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360
Let's be very clear about boundaries, what communication responsibilities belong to you,

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.160
and what remains with the service advisor. You should handle technical explanations,

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.880
what you found during diagnosis, why repairs are necessary, how systems work,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.320
and what happens if the customer waits. This is your expertise. You should discuss vehicle

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.560
condition, show them worn or damaged parts, demonstrate problems, explain severity levels,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.000
provide visual evidence and measurements. This is what builds understanding and trust,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.720
and you should address repair necessity. Why is this specific repair recommended?

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.160
What do Porsche engineering specifications say? What are the safety or performance implications?

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.040
These are professional recommendations based on your expertise, and while situations vary

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.200
from one shop to another, here's what remains with the service advisor.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.360
Pricing Discussions and Negotiations

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.240
Final cost quotes, payment options, discounts, or promotional offers.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.240
That's not necessarily your domain as the technician. Timing promises, specific

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.440
completion commitments, scheduling, loaner coordination, delivery promises. The

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.360
service advisor manages these, although some input from you is required,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.640
and warranty issues, coverage determinations, claim processing,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.440
policy interpretations. These are handled by the service advisor and management,

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.600
but once again, you will have some input. Why does this division matter?

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.200
Because it allows you to maintain credibility as an objective expert.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.720
You're not selling. You're assessing. You're not negotiating.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.840
You're explaining. Your role is to provide honest technical evaluation

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.960
and help the customer understand their vehicle's needs.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.640
The service advisor handles the business transaction side.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.280
This clear division actually makes your job easier. You don't need to know pricing details

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.040
or make promises about timing. You focus on what you do best.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.000
Technical Expertise and Clear Explanation
