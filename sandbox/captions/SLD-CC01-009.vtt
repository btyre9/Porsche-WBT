00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560
Let's look at the reality of your work.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.760
You interact with customers more often than you might realize,

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.200
and each interaction type requires communication skills.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.920
Click each scenario card to explore when and how you communicate with customers.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.160
As you can see, customer interaction isn't rare, it's a regular part of your role.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.960
Video updates, direct conversations, vehicle walkthroughs,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.960
phone calls, enthusiast discussions, problem resolution,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.960
all of these happen routinely.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.040
Here's what's important to understand.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.920
Each of these scenarios is an opportunity to strengthen the customer's connection to Portia.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.920
Your technical expertise is what qualifies you for these conversations.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.720
Your communication skills are what make them successful.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.480
In the upcoming modules, you'll develop specific techniques

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.000
for each of these interaction types.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.560
But first, let's make sure you understand

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.680
what customers are actually seeking when they request to speak with you.
