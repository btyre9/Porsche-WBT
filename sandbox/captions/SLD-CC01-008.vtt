00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
Now let's connect your communication skills to something your dealership cares deeply about,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.320
Customer Satisfaction Index Scores or CSI. CSI measures customer satisfaction across five

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.720
dimensions. Service initiation, that's how easy it is to schedule. Service advisor,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.840
the quality of that relationship. Service facility, the comfort and cleanliness.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.480
Vehicle pickup, the ease and value of that process. And service quality, the actual work

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.520
performed and how it's communicated. Click on service quality to see why this dimension

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.880
matters most to you. Service quality represents 34% of the total CSI score. It's the largest single

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.840
factor and look at what drives it. Theuriness of your work, condition of the vehicle when

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.280
returned, quality of communication and updates and explanations and total time required.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.120
You directly control all of these. Your technical work, yes. But also your communication.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.920
How well do you explain what you found? How thoroughly do you update the service advisor?

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.880
How well do you document and writing all the work performed? How carefully do you ensure the vehicle

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.800
is returned in pristine condition? Here's why CSI matters beyond just metrics. It affects

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:21.280
dealership incentives and allocations from Porsche. Strong CSI creates opportunities for the entire

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.200
team, including better resources, training and support for you. Porsche consistently ranks at the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.160
top in customer satisfaction studies. Your technical excellence is part of the reason.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.200
Your professional communication is the other part. Both matter equally.
