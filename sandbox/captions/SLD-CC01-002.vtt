00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760
You've been selected for this training because you're advancing to an elite level.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.360
Gold certified technicians are rare. There are only a handful worldwide who achieve this

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.720
distinction. You represent years of experience, extensive training, and deep expertise with

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.640
Porsche vehicles. But here's what's changing. Porsche customers increasingly want direct

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.560
access to you. They request command performance us. They want to speak with the technician

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.160
who actually worked on their car. They want expert explanations, professional communication,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.360
and the complete Porsche experience that matches what they paid for.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.280
Your technical skills got you here. This training ensures your communication skills

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.200
match that expertise. Over the next 12 modules, you'll develop the tools to confidently handle

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.000
any customer interaction, from routine conversations to challenging situations.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.800
Let's begin by understanding exactly what it means to be a brand ambassador.
