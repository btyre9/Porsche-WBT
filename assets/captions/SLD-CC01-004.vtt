00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840
Let's start with the fundamental question. What is a Porsche brand ambassador? At your level,

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.600
you're not just a technician anymore. You're a brand ambassador. This means that in every

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.760
customer interaction, whether in person on the phone or through video, you represent Porsche,

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.640
not just your dealership, Porsche itself. So what does that actually encompass?

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.200
First, your technical expertise, your forthcoming gold level diagnostic capabilities

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.800
and deep knowledge of Porsche systems. That's the foundation, but it's not the whole picture.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.440
It also includes your professionalism, how you present yourself, how you communicate,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.400
and your attention to detail and everything you do. Your communication skills matter.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.320
Can you explain complex technical concepts clearly? Do you build customer confidence?

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.120
Can you manage their expectations effectively? Your appearance and demeanor count.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.280
Are you presenting yourself professionally? Are you approachable yet confident?

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.080
Do you show respect for customer concerns even when they seem minor to you?

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.760
And finally, your passion for the brand. Your enthusiasm for Porsche engineering.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.640
Your pride in your work and your commitment to excellence. Customers can feel whether you're

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.440
just doing a job or whether you truly care about what you do. All of these elements

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.160
together make you a brand ambassador. And that's the standard you're being held to

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.160
as an advanced technician.
