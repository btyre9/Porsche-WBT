00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's be clear about something. You're not just another automotive technician.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.120
What distinguishes you from technicians at independent shops or even from technicians

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.920
at other premium brand dealerships? First, you're on the gold certification path.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.560
This isn't something you achieve overnight. It requires years of dedication,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.200
continuous learning, and mastery of increasingly complex Porsche systems.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.360
Most technicians never reach this level. Second, factory training.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.960
You receive many hours of annual Porsche-specific training.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.760
That's not generic automotive training. It's direct access to Porsche engineering knowledge,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.160
the latest updates, diagnostic techniques, and procedures straight from the factory.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.160
Independent shops don't have this. Third, years of Porsche-specific experience.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.600
You've developed a deep understanding of how Porsche vehicles are different.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.080
You've built pattern recognition from working on hundreds of these cars.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.120
You have expertise that only comes from dedicated focus on one brand's engineering philosophy.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.320
Finally, you need to understand just how rare you are.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.480
Globally, very few technicians reach this level. You're among the best in the entire Porsche network

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.840
worldwide. Your knowledge and skills are genuinely exceptional. Here's what this means.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.800
Customers know they're getting the best when they work with you.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.200
Your job is to ensure the communication experience matches the technical expertise.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.200
That's what we're going to help you develop.
