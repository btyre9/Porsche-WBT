00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
Let's end this first module with the most important concept you need to remember.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.280
You don't just work for Porsche. You are Porsche.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.840
Think about that for a moment. When a customer interacts with you,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.040
whether face-to-face on the phone or through a video update,

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.840
they may not be thinking, this is my technician. But they're certainly thinking,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.360
this is Porsche. They don't separate you from the brand.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.640
Your professionalism is Porsche's professionalism.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.320
Your expertise is Porsche's expertise. Your communication is Porsche's communication.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.640
In every conversation you either deliver on the Porsche brand promise or you don't.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.040
There's no middle ground. The customer either walks away thinking,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.600
that's why I bought a Porsche or they don't. Here's what makes your position unique.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.280
Very few people in the world reach your technical level with Porsche.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.760
That alone is valuable. But when you combine that technical mastery with communication

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.280
excellence, you become irreplaceable. You become exactly what Porsche customers are seeking.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.840
You become the reason they remain loyal to the brand.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.040
Take pride in this role. You've earned your place as a Porsche expert through years of

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.720
dedication and continuous learning. This communication training elevates you even further.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.360
It makes you a complete professional, technical mastery combined with communication

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.960
excellence. That's a true brand ambassador in every sense.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.560
When this is what you become, that customer will see you and not only say,

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.400
this is Porsche, but they will also say, this is my Porsche technician. So what's next?

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.160
In the next 11 modules, you'll develop specific communication techniques

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.400
for every situation you'll encounter. You'll learn frameworks for listening,

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.760
questioning, explaining technical concepts, handling objections, and de-escalating difficult

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.480
situations. By the end of this training series, you'll have the complete toolkit

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.160
to confidently represent Porsche at the highest level. You're ready.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.040
Let's build these skills together. When you're prepared, continue to the quiz to test your

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:06.160
understanding of what we've covered today. A score of 80% is required to pass.
