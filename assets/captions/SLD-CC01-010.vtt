Understanding what customers are really seeking from you and what they're not helps you approach

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.400
these interactions with the right mindset. Let's start with what customers are seeking

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.440
when they ask to speak with you. They want credibility from the actual expert. As one

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.640
customer put it, I want to hear it from the person who actually knows. You have credibility

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.520
that others don't. They want transparency and unfiltered information. They want the

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.120
truth about their car, not a filtered or simplified version. They want technical depth.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.840
They have questions the service advisor may not be able to answer at the level they need.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.000
They want to build trust through direct conversation. They need to feel confident

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.120
in their decision, especially when facing expensive repairs. And many want shared

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.520
enthusiasm. They want to talk to someone who understands and appreciates what makes

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.920
special. Now, what are they not seeking? They're not looking to negotiate price with you.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.880
Some situations vary, but that's the service advisor's responsibility, not yours.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.200
They're not trying to catch you in a lie or challenge your diagnosis aggressively.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.000
When they ask questions, they're seeking honest answers, not looking for confrontation.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.240
They're not expecting you to resolve warranty disputes. Management handles those

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.800
situations and they're not trying to waste your time. Most customers genuinely

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.840
respect your expertise and value your input. Here's the key insight you need to remember.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.880
Portia owners are often enthusiasts. They actually want to understand their vehicles.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.760
They respect trustworthy technical expertise. For many of them, speaking with you is a

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.640
highlight of their service experience, not a complaint or a problem. Approach these

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.640
conversations with that understanding and they become much easier.
