00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
So why does this brand ambassador designation exist?

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.520
Why is Porsche investing in communication training for senior technicians?

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.600
Three critical reasons.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.720
First, Porsche customers have extraordinarily high expectations,

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.120
and these expectations aren't just about the vehicle, they're about the entire experience.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.880
When someone invests in a Porsche, they expect every interaction to reflect that premium brand

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.800
The service experience must match the purchase experience and the driving experience.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.440
Anything less feels like a broken promise.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.120
Second, every interaction matters, every single one.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.600
Each conversation you have with a customer either strengthens their connection to Porsche

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.560
or weakens it. Even small negative experiences can damage lifetime loyalty.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.960
But positive interactions?

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.520
Those create lasting brand advocates who tell everyone they know about their exceptional Porsche

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.280
experience. Third, you have unique credibility that others don't.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.960
Advanced technicians like you possess expertise that service advisors may not have,

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.080
at least not at your depth. Customers know this.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.040
They trust the person who actually worked on their car.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.120
When you combine your technical knowledge with professional communication skills,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.320
that's incredibly powerful. Here's the bottom line.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.720
Your role as brand ambassador isn't optional, it's not a nice to have.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.720
It's essential to maintaining Porsche's reputation and customer loyalty.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.920
That's why this designation exists, and that's why you're here.
