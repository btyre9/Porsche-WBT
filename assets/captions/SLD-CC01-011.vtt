00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
Here's something critical to understand.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.280
As an advanced technician, you have a dual responsibility.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.440
You must excel at both sides of your role.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.400
On one side, technical expertise.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.800
You diagnose accurately, repair correctly, use proper procedures,

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.200
maintain quality standards, and stay current with rapidly evolving technology.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.320
This is what you've spent years mastering.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.480
This is what got you to this level.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.360
But that's only half of what's expected of you now.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.520
The other side is communication excellence.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.920
You must ensure customers understand what you found and why it matters.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.440
You build confidence and trust through how you explain things.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.440
You manage their expectations.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.280
You translate complex technical concepts into language they can grasp.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.440
And you maintain professionalism even in difficult situations.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.480
Both sides are equally important.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.040
Technical expertise without communication skills means customers don't approve work,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.560
don't understand recommendations, and don't trust the process.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.320
Communication skills without technical expertise is meaningless.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.800
You have nothing valuable to communicate.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.160
Here's the reality.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.480
Many technicians excel at the technical side.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.600
That's a basic requirement at this level.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.120
Fewer excel at both.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.680
But advanced Porsche technicians must master both to truly represent the brand.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.640
And there's another dimension to this, your leadership role.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.040
Bronze and silver technicians in your shop watch you and learn from you.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.080
You set the standard for how communication should be done.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.280
Your behavior, good or bad, shapes the shop culture.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.400
You lead through example whether you intend to or not.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.040
This training is designed to develop the communication side of your dual role

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.280
so it matches your technical mastery.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.920
That's what makes you a complete brand ambassador.
